<h1 align="center">David Harris - Milestone Project 2</h1>

The aim of this project is to build a fully interactive front-end only website using the skills that I have learnt with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript & jQuery. I will be building a memory based visual card game. The purpose of the game is firstly to be a fun and enjoyable game but to also be used for education for younger children. The game will be designed with the view to aid in early learning and development for younger children.

## User Experience (UX)

### User stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals
- As a first-time visitor I want to easily understand the main purpose of the website.
- As a first-time visitor I want the game to be very basic and easy to understand as the audience demographic will be younger children.
- As a first-time visitor I want to enjoy the game on the first play through and not hit and frustrations with an overly complicate game or rules.

 #### Returning Visitor Goals
- As a returning visitor I want to see if I can improve on my personal time score since the last visit to the website.
- As a returning visitor I want to continue to enjoy the game on multiple play throughs.

#### Frequent User Goals
- As a frequent visitor I want to be able to see if I can beat my all-time high time score of the game over the course of my multiple visits to the website to enjoy the game.
- As a frequent visitor I want to see if I can notice an improvement to my pattern matching skills because I have been training by playing the game many times.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
- I will be using bold and bright colours to have the content of the website be visually appealing for a younger audience. I have done some research into games aimed at younger children and they all use various colour schemes but always have bright and bold colours.
- The theme of the game will be cartoon based animals. I have done some research into younger children’s books and a lot of books involve cartoon animals. I would like to continue this theme as the target audience of younger children would already been accustomed and have an established appreciation of this theme.

#### Typography
- The font that I have chosen is for this website is “Gloria Hallelujah” via “Google Fonts”. I have chosen this font to appeal to the younger children. I like that this is a non-business, non-serious font. I find that it is a relaxed font and leads itself well to a younger audience.

#### Wireframes

- [Mobile View Wireframe](assets/wireframes/wireframe-mobile-view.pdf)
- [Tablet View Wireframe](assets/wireframes/wireframe-tablet-view.pdf)

### Features
- Feature 1 – “Welcome message & Game Instructions”. There will be an automatic pop-up when the page has loaded to offer a welcome message and a brief set of simple instructions on how to start the game and how to win the game. This is designed to make it as easy as possible for younger children to both understand and enjoy playing the game.
- Feature 2 – “Memory-based Card Game”. This will be the bulk of the content of the website. There will be a 4 x 4 flip card-based memory game. The object of the game will be to correctly match all pairs of cards in as least moves as possible.
- Feature 3 – “Timer countdown”. There will be a countdown clock starting from 60 seconds that will start when the user starts the game. The user will fail the game if the time limit is reached.
- Feature  4 – “Responsive Design”. I want the website a mobile first friendly design. I want all content to appear clear and present a good design across all device sizes.
